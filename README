Using Stanford integer matrix multiply to learn x86 assembly for fun
    Figured it is easier than 8Queens and is common target
    for optimization. Beating the compiler in # of instructions
    in the inner loop but failing to make my loop faster. It isn't 
    that far off though!

Downloaded the IntMM benchmark and re-wrote the function 'Innerproduct'. 
    * InnerproductPASM: Pseudo-assembly template of what I wanted to do in ASM
    * InnerproductASM: x86 assembly
